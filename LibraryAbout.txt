Power Monday Library
Welcome to Power Monday Library!

Power Monday Library is an initiative of Power Monday, a corporate social responsibility program by Live Your Dream Enterprises. Power Monday is a platform dedicated to personal development, where members gather every Monday from 7:15 AM to 8:15 AM EAT (except on public holidays in Kenya) to network and learn. The main focus is on four key areas: Financial, Physical, Social, and Spiritual well-being, with various topics ranging from business development, character growth, emotional intelligence, and more.

Our library is a curated collection of books authored by members and their extended network, who have led or contributed to different Power Monday sessions. These books reflect the wisdom and experiences shared during our weekly meetings, providing valuable insights for personal and professional growth.

The library currently offers hardcopy books for borrowing, with plans to introduce softcopy versions soon. A borrowing fee applies to help maintain and expand our collection.
